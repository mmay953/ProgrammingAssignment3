The dataset contains 69 columns and summarizes data from the
"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0"

Data collection:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing 
a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial 
linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded 
to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 



Identifying characteristics
 [1] "subject"            	identifies the test-person     
 [2] "activity"           	identifies the activity that was carried-out during the data collection
 [3] "dataset"                 	identifies the source data set ("train" or "test")

Features (mean and standard deviation)
	The remaining columns return the average of the mean (labeled as "mean") 
	and the standard deviation (labeled as "std") of the distinct features.

	The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
	Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

	The following features have been included:
	'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

		tBodyAcc-XYZ
		tGravityAcc-XYZ
		tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
		tBodyGyro-XYZ
		tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
		tBodyAccMag
		tGravityAccMag
		tBodyAccJerkMag
		tBodyGyroMag
		tBodyGyroJerkMag
		fBodyAcc-XYZ
		fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
		fBodyGyro-XYZ
		fBodyAccMag
		fBodyAccJerkMag
		fBodyGyroMag
		fBodyGyroJerkMag
	Each of these features has been standard-normalized.
The application of the mean & standard variation to each of the features returns the following columns:

 [4] "tBodyAccmeanX"           	Mean of Body Acceleration - Dimension X
 [5] "tBodyAccmeanY"     	Mean of Body Acceleration - Dimension Y
